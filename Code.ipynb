    "*Using an English-English dictionary containing numerous words with their explanations, the eight emotion sets of Plutchik's Wheel were generated. The primary emotions of Plutchik's Wheel are joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Initially, dictionaries were formed for each emotion, where words were used as 'keys' and their number as 'values'. The words found within the explanation of each emotion were included in their respective dictionary, along with their numbers. Following that, the dictionaries were expanded by adding the words found within the explanations of each 'key'. The repetition of this process is controllable by the depth of the set function. In the event of encountering duplicate words, the 'value' will be incremented based on their number.*\n",
