    "## *The creation of the eight emotion sets of Plutchik's Wheel*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Using an English-English dictionary containing numerous words with their explanations, the eight emotion sets of Plutchik's Wheel were generated. The primary emotions of Plutchik's Wheel are joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Initially, dictionaries were formed for each emotion, where the words were utilized as 'keys' and their corresponding numbers as 'values'. The words found within the explanation of each emotion were included in their respective dictionaries, along with their associated numbers. Following that, the dictionaries were expanded by adding the words found within the explanations of each 'key'. The repetition of this process was controllable by the depth of the implemented function. In the event of encountering duplicate words, the 'value' was incremented based on their numbers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally, the dictionaries for each emotion were saved as separate JSON files for future usage.*"
